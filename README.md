    This project is suppose to be an analytics tool for aspiring influceners. The plan so far is to have 2 main sections. The dashboard which will show the analytics of all linked accounts. This would show things like total views, total likes, total engagments (whatever I can get from the different APIs obviously). Ideally, I would also like to allow for the user to look at the seperate platforms analytics as well.

    The second section will be what im calling "Connect". This would be like a dating app but for content creators to link up for collabs. The second could be a tinder clone until I am able to think of something more creative for it.

    Another section would have to be a profile section that allows for the content creator to customize their profile for the connect part. Basically just allowing for the user to upload a profile picture, add a bio, and their location that they want to look at for the connect.
